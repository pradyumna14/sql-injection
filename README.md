# sql-injection
This project builds a deep neural network model to detect SQL injection attacks by learning from large datasets of malicious and legitimate queries. Relevant features are extracted for training, enabling the model to identify complex patterns. The system uses Python/C++ with deep learning for sequence-based attack detection.
